        When in doubt, solve a different problem
        Polyglot, multi-app approach
          - 3 apps
          - Search, CMS, Static Generator
          - Hosted on Heroku -- Cheaper, faster
          - S3 to host the static pages, Cloudfront to cache them
          - Harvard handles images for us
          - Do (implied: pay) less, get more.


        Old-school tactics -- Plain old HTML pages

        -- Old approach with a modern twist -- AWS services like S3 and CloudFront for speed and simplicity

        -- Meant we needed to solve more, smaller problems 

        -- How to Build the Production Site?
          -- S3, CloudFront, and Plain-old HTML
        -- How to Search?
          -- ElasticSearch for tunable, fast, language aware search
        -- How to host?
          -- Heroku for cheap, simple hosting and devops.
            -- Devops means "Developer Operations" ie - a dev doing all the
               traditional IT tasks
        -- How to Improve?
          -- Neo4j for <i>semantic</i> search

        Site is live!

        ElasticSearch is Awesome!
          - ElasticSearch allows us to search _everything_ transcripts,
            translations, any text we enter can be searched

        Much easier to maintain

        Easier to deploy (publication model)

        <!--#################### -->

        Improve the CMS
          - Lots of room to tweak and make things easier

        Cloudfront Coming Soon(tm)
          - Will make it _even faster_

        <!--#################### -->

        Better integration with Library system
          - make the curator's lives easier
          - make for rapid introduction of new content to the production site.
          - every item needs to move lots of large images to harvard library
            server  
            - Plan: Sneakernet + Automatic import of Library Receipt
            - Emphasizing the Simplest thing that could possibly work
            - For even a large increase in problem size, constant solution size

        <!--#################### -->

        - genealogy
          - what they thought they wanted
        - genealogy++ 
          - add lots of relationships between more than just people
        - semantic graph
          - complicated, full of information
          

        - importance
          - Finding out which nodes are most influential (subject to
            constraints)
          - Examples: Big Cities, Important Political/Cultural Leaders, etc
          - Constraint might limit importance relative to particular
            people/places/things
          - Example Question: "Most important Person Before 1850 with respect
            to manuscripts, excluding connections through Tehran"
            - Why exclude Tehran? 
              Because it's a _very_ popular node, likely to cause false
              importance

        - nontrivial relationships
          - builds on importance 
          - find connections between people/places/items
          - determine likelihood that they know each other / interacted with
            each other
          - Example: "How many times were these two people in the same small
            town 50 miles south of Tehran"
          - Example: "What is the distribution of path-lengths between two
            people"
            - Need to exclude highly connected nodes, to prevent skewing the
              data
          
        - cliques
          - a clique is a group of objects with high internal connections, but
          low external connections
          - example: Distant Different social networks -- Eg, My social network, I move to
          Chicago, Start a new social net -- My old social network = one clique, my new
          social network = another clique, I'm the connection.
          - example: Montagues and Capulets
          - example question: What were the discrete social worlds of Qajar
            Iran?
            - answer: No idea, Clique analysis is really hard.

        - what else?
          - cliques form a graph
          - all the previous questions can be asked about cliques
            - what are important discrete social worlds in Qajar Iran?
            - How are two different social groups related?
            - What are the super groups of smaller social groups?
          - Proceed ad infinitum

        - How can we make this happen
          - More data = Better answers
            - Make it easier to enter data
          - Graph Database with good UI -- designed for non-programmers
          - Inference Engines
            - Ask all the questions, remember the answers.
        
        - Progress toward this goal:
          - CMS 
            - easier to enter data
          - Neo4j
            - Graph Database extracted from the curated data

        - Future Goals
          - Good UI to the Neo4j Database
          - Inference Engines
            - Infer nth-order edges (eg: This is someones second cousin)
            - Cache Importance Metrics (eg: How important is this node?)
            - Cache Relationship Metrics (eg: This nth order relationship
            indicates a high probability that these two objects are related)
            - Cache Clique analysis
            - Caching is for speed

        Things we've been able to give back to the FLOSS community:

        - graphable
          - A gem that drives extracting the semantic graph information from the
            system modelling
          - Works transparently on many systems using the same underlying
            database mapping API
        
        - searchable
          - Potential gem extracted from the code that builds the search index
          - Provide a thin layer on top of the excellent Tire gem to make
            rapidly building multi-lingual Search indexes easy
          - Provide a thin layer to aid in building searches across multiple
            languages

        - enviable
          - Tool for managing multiple configuration sources

        - static page generator
          - This too could be extracted an made generic. 
          - Would provide a powerful way for other, similar projects to
            systematically convert their site into a pre-cached set of html
            pages for S3 and Cloudfront
          - Needs the most effort to make work.

        This doesn't even begin to cover the numerous bugs uncovered, solutions
        found (and given back to the community), and the wealth of potential
        tools that will be born out of the Neo4j integration. 

        It's not only helping history and WWQI, but also the FLOSS community by
        virtue of our use and contribution to FLOSS tools.
